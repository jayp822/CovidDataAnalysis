Dr. Phelps/Liu has allowed students to discuss the algorithm and/or general concepts about the assignment 
with other students and to receive limited help on specific topics. However, I assume full responsibility 
for the content and integrity of this assignment. I have developed my own solution to this assigned project. 
I have not used or copied (by any means) anotherï¿½s work (or portions of it) in order to represent it as my 
own including material from the internet. If I used a common computer, I have remembered to delete the files 
and empty the recycle bin. I have destroyed all extra printouts of my code. I have not shared my code with 
anyone. I am sole author of the assignment; however,

I received outside help from the following people: None

These are the websites that I used as reference: None
